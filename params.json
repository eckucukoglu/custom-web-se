{"name":"Custom Web Search Engine Project","tagline":"Custom Web Search Engine aims enthusiastic searchers, who wants higher precision and recall values. Custom Web SE has modifiable information retrieval techniques to increase result quality.","body":"# Summary\r\n\r\nWe will design simple web search engine. Engine settings can be modified by user, thus for an \r\nenthusiastic searchers, precision and recall values can be increased. Engine takes a website address as \r\nan argument and starts crawling until reaching the depth which is also given as argument. Before the \r\ncrawling operation, user can set\r\n\r\n * Initial web address for initiation of crawling\r\n * Depth limit\r\n * Stemming,\r\n * Ranking,\r\n * Compression technique, \r\n * Ignored websites list,\r\n * Whitelists,\r\n * tba\r\n\r\nRetrieved websites automatically indexed and according to user settings, dictionary stored on a server.\r\nOn the client side, user can search in corpus that is created. User can select as an option in addition to \r\nkeyword query:\r\n\r\n * Pivot website address, (use my query and this website’s relation)\r\n * tba\r\n\r\nBesides the techniques that are described above Java is used for server-side implementation. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we will benefit from the information retrieval functionalities of Apache Lucene. \r\n\r\n# Sample user story\r\nUser always searches ‘linux operating systems’ based queries. Thus, user sets initial web address as \r\nhttps://www.kernel.org/ which is base for linux kernel. User can set depth limit as 5, and with the help of \r\nother options (they will be developed while implementing), can start crawling the web. Since almost all \r\ncrawled websites are related with linux, corpus’s recall and precision values are expected to be higher. \r\nAfter crawling phase, user can set a pivot website. According to query, cosine distance of pivot website \r\nwill help engine to get intended results. Ranked search results are shown with or without pivot site.\r\n\r\n# Contributers\r\n* [Emre Can Kucukoglu](https://github.com/eckucukoglu/)\r\n* [Fatih Hafizoglu](https://github.com/fatihafizoglu)\r\n* [Yigit Ilguner](https://github.com/e1560762)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
